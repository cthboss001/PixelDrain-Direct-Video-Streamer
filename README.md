A simple web tool to stream any video hosted on PixelDrain directly in your browser â€” without needing to download it first.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸŽ¬ Paste your PixelDrain link and start streaming immediately.
- ðŸš€ Instant playback without any need for external players or downloads.
- ðŸ›  Built entirely with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no frameworks.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project solves a practical need:
> "How can users watch videos stored on PixelDrain without downloading the full file?"

PixelDrain provides simple file hosting but lacks a seamless streaming option for videos.  
This tool makes it possible to fetch a video using PixelDrainâ€™s public API and play it directly inside a browser video player.  
No extra apps, no waiting for full downloads â€” just paste the link and press Play.

Ideal for:
- Previewing large video files quickly.
- Saving bandwidth by only streaming what you watch.
- Using PixelDrain as a simple video server.

## ðŸ“¦ How It Works

1. User pastes their PixelDrain file link.
2. Script extracts the file ID.
3. Constructs a direct API link like `https://pixeldrain.com/api/file/FILE_ID`.
4. Loads that link into the browserâ€™s `<video>` player.
5. Video plays instantly using native HTML5 video streaming.

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Is Useful

- Faster access to large video files.
- No downloads means saving time and storage.
- Zero backend needed â€” fully client-side.
- Can be used for personal media servers, file previews, or quick project demos.
