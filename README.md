A simple web tool to stream any video hosted on PixelDrain directly in your browser — without needing to download it first.

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 Paste your PixelDrain link and start streaming immediately.
- 🚀 Instant playback without any need for external players or downloads.

## 📋 Project Description

This project solves a practical need:
> "How can users watch videos stored on PixelDrain without downloading the full file?"

PixelDrain provides simple file hosting but lacks a seamless streaming option for videos.  
This tool makes it possible to fetch a video using PixelDrain’s public API and play it directly inside a browser video player.  
No extra apps, no waiting for full downloads — just paste the link and press Play.

Ideal for:
- Previewing large video files quickly.
- Saving bandwidth by only streaming what you watch.
- Using PixelDrain as a simple video server.

## 📦 How It Works

1. User pastes their PixelDrain file link.
2. Script extracts the file ID.
3. Constructs a direct API link like `https://pixeldrain.com/api/file/FILE_ID`.
4. Loads that link into the browser’s `<video>` player.
5. Video plays instantly using native HTML5 video streaming.

## 🔥 Why This Is Useful

- Faster access to large video files.
- No downloads means saving time and storage.
- Zero backend needed — fully client-side.
- Can be used for personal media servers, file previews, or quick project demos.
